# Welcome to Gatekeeper, a drum machine with a difference

Gatekeeper is a drum machine that aims to move beyond the traditional drum sounds of kick, hi-hat, and snare. Instead of playing individual drum samples, Gatekeeper starts with a single, rich sound, and creates a rhythm by letting different parts of the sound through.

## Instructions

First, choose a "tape" to be your sound source. Click the eject button on the tape player, and select the sound you would like to use. Press the play button on the tape player to start the tape playing.

Next, add some beats to your pattern. Start with the channel one, and click the first beat button (labelled "one"). You should hear a sound on the first beat of the bar. Try adding more beats to the other channels, and listen for the difference between them.

Now try adjusting the knobs on each channel. Start with the frequency ("freq") - turn it slowly up and down and listen for the difference it makes. Next, try changing the attack and release knobs, and see how they affect the sound.

If you get stuck, hit the "reset" button to put everything back to its original settings.

## Troubleshooting

If you're having trouble getting Gatekeeper to work, and the "reset" button isn't helping, try refreshing the page. Also, make sure your speakers are turned on and your volume is not muted! If you think you've found an error, or if you have a suggestion for an improvement, please send me a message.
