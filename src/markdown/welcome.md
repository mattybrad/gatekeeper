# Welcome to Gatekeeper, a drum machine with a difference

Gatekeeper is a drum machine that aims to move beyond the traditional drum sounds of kick, hi-hat, and snare. Instead of playing individual drum samples, Gatekeeper starts with a single, rich sound, and creates a rhythm by only letting certain parts of the sound (low, medium, high, etc) through at different times.

## Instructions

Start by pressing the "play" button on the cassette player. This will feed a sound into the three rhythm channels. Try playing with the cassette player buttons first: you can rewind or fast-forward the tape, or eject it to try a different sound.

Next, try pressing the coloured buttons to toggle each step of a channel's pattern on or off. You can also create a new, blank pattern by pressing the "pattern 2" or "pattern 3" buttons.

Finally, try changing all the other controls - "speed" and "freq" are probably the most fun to get started with, before moving onto the subtler ones. If you would like to know more about a particular control, click on its label.

Have fun!
