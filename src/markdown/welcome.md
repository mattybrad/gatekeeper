# Welcome to Gatekeeper, a drum machine with a difference

Gatekeeper is a drum machine that aims to move beyond the traditional drum sounds of kick, hi-hat, and snare. Instead of playing individual drum samples, Gatekeeper starts with a single, rich sound, and creates a rhythm by only letting certain parts of the sound (low, medium, high, etc) through at different times.

## Instructions

First, choose a "tape" to be your sound source. Click the eject button on the tape player, and select the sound you would like to use. Press the play button on the tape player to start the tape playing.

Next, add some beats to your pattern. Start with channel one, and click the first beat button (labelled "one"). You should hear a sound on the first beat of the bar. Try adding more beats to the other channels, and listen for the difference between them.

Now try adjusting the knobs on each channel. Start with the frequency ("freq") - turn it slowly up and down and listen for the difference it makes. Next, try changing the attack and release knobs, and see how they affect the sound.

Have fun!
